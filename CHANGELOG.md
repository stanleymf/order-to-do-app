## Version Management

### How to use version management:

```bash
# Check current version
node scripts/version.js current

# Increment patch version (1.0.0 â†’ 1.0.1)
node scripts/version.js patch

# Increment minor version (1.0.0 â†’ 1.1.0)
node scripts/version.js minor

# Increment major version (1.0.0 â†’ 2.0.0)
node scripts/version.js major

# Set specific version
node scripts/version.js set 1.5.0
```

### Version Guidelines:
- **Patch** (1.0.0 â†’ 1.0.1): Bug fixes, minor improvements
- **Minor** (1.0.0 â†’ 1.1.0): New features, backward compatible
- **Major** (1.0.0 â†’ 2.0.0): Breaking changes, major features 

## [1.0.35] - 2024-06-14

### Enhanced

- **Smart Sync Options**: Updated Settings with detailed sync interval options and rate limit guidance

### Added
- **Sync Interval Options**: 
  - 10 seconds (Very Fast) - ~2 API calls/minute
  - 30 seconds (Fast) - ~4 API calls/minute  
  - 1 minute (Recommended) - ~2 API calls/minute
  - 5+ minutes (Conservative) - Minimal API usage
- **Rate Limit Handling**: Backend proxy now handles Shopify's 429 rate limit responses with proper retry guidance
- **Shop Domain Rate Limiting**: Per-shop rate limiting to prevent overwhelming individual stores

### Technical
- **Default Sync**: Changed default from 5 minutes to 1 minute for better responsiveness
- **Error Handling**: Improved error messages for rate limit scenarios
- **Performance**: Conservative rate limiting (100 requests/minute) to stay well under Shopify's 120/minute limit

## [1.0.34] - 2024-06-14

## [1.0.33] - 2024-06-14

- **Server**: Updated server.js to use Node 18's native fetch API
- **Deployment**: Railway deployment should now succeed

## [1.0.32] - 2024-06-14
