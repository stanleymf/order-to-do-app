# Railway Environment Setup for Multi-Store Webhooks

## üîß Required Environment Variables

### Essential Variables

| Variable Name | Purpose | Required | Default | Security Level |
|---------------|---------|----------|---------|----------------|
| `SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Webhook signature verification | **YES** | `default-webhook-secret` | **HIGH - Should be sealed** |

### Optional Performance Variables

| Variable Name | Purpose | Recommended Value | Description |
|---------------|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| `NODE_ENV` | Environment mode | `production` | Optimizes Node.js performance |
| `RAILWAY_HEALTHCHECK_TIMEOUT_SEC` | Health check timeout | `30` | Railway health check timeout |
| `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_OVERLAP_SECONDS` | Zero-downtime deployment | `10` | Overlap time during deployments |

### Railway-Provided Variables (Automatic)
These are automatically provided by Railway and don't need manual configuration:

| Variable Name | Purpose | Provided By |
|---------------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | Server port | Railway |
| `RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` | Public webhook URL | Railway |
| `RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN` | Private service domain | Railway |

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Configure SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET

1. **Go to your Railway project dashboard**
2. **Navigate to your service ‚Üí Variables tab**
3. **Add a new variable:**
   - **Name:** `SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
   - **Value:** A secure random string (recommend 32+ characters)
   - **Security:** Consider sealing this variable for production

#### Generate a secure webhook secret:
```bash
# Option 1: Using openssl
openssl rand -hex 32

# Option 2: Using node
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"

# Option 3: Online generator
# Use https://passwordsgenerator.net/ (64 character alphanumeric)
```

### Step 2: Configure Optional Performance Variables

For production optimization, add these variables:

```env
NODE_ENV=production
RAILWAY_HEALTHCHECK_TIMEOUT_SEC=30
RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_OVERLAP_SECONDS=10
```

### Step 3: Verify Environment Variables

After setting up the variables:

1. **Deploy your service** (Railway auto-deploys on variable changes)
2. **Check the deployment logs** for confirmation:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Server running on port: [PORT]
   üîó Webhook endpoint: https://[YOUR-DOMAIN]/api/webhooks/shopify
   üíö Health check: https://[YOUR-DOMAIN]/health
   ```

### Step 4: Test Webhook Connectivity

The app includes multiple monitoring endpoints:

1. **Health Check:** `https://[your-domain]/health`
2. **API Status:** `https://[your-domain]/api/status`
3. **Built-in Test:** Use "Test Connectivity" in webhook management

## üîí Security Best Practices

### Seal Sensitive Variables
For production environments, seal the webhook secret:

1. **Go to Variables tab**
2. **Click the 3-dot menu** next to `SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
3. **Select "Seal"**
4. **Confirm sealing** (cannot be undone)

### Environment Separation
Consider using different webhook secrets for different environments:

- **Production:** Sealed variable with strong secret
- **Staging:** Regular variable for testing
- **Development:** Local environment variable

## üìã Complete Railway Variable Setup

### Production Configuration
```env
# Required
SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=[your-secure-32-char-secret]

# Performance Optimization
NODE_ENV=production
RAILWAY_HEALTHCHECK_TIMEOUT_SEC=30
RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_OVERLAP_SECONDS=10
```

### Development Configuration
```env
# Required
SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=dev-webhook-secret-for-testing

# Development
NODE_ENV=development
```

## üìã Verification Checklist

- [ ] `SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` set with secure value (32+ chars)
- [ ] `NODE_ENV=production` for production deployments
- [ ] Variable sealed for production security
- [ ] Service deployed successfully
- [ ] Health check endpoint accessible at `/health`
- [ ] API status endpoint accessible at `/api/status`
- [ ] Webhook endpoint accessible at `/api/webhooks/shopify`
- [ ] Test connectivity passes
- [ ] Railway domain format: `https://[service-name]-[project-name].up.railway.app`

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Webhook verification failures**
```
‚ùå Webhook verification failed
```
- **Solution:** Ensure `SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` matches Shopify app configuration

**2. 404 errors on webhook endpoint**
```
‚ùå Webhook endpoint not found
```
- **Solution:** Verify Railway deployment is successful and server.js is running

**3. Environment variable not found**
```
No webhook secret configured, skipping verification
```
- **Solution:** Set `SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Railway Variables tab

**4. Health check failures**
```
Railway health check timeout
```
- **Solution:** Increase `RAILWAY_HEALTHCHECK_TIMEOUT_SEC` or fix startup issues

### Debug Steps

1. **Check Railway deployment logs:**
   ```
   railway logs
   ```

2. **Verify environment variables:**
   ```
   railway run env | grep SHOPIFY
   ```

3. **Test health check:**
   ```bash
   curl https://[your-domain].up.railway.app/health
   ```

4. **Test API status:**
   ```bash
   curl https://[your-domain].up.railway.app/api/status
   ```

5. **Test webhook endpoint manually:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://[your-domain].up.railway.app/api/webhooks/shopify \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "X-Shopify-Topic: test" \
     -H "X-Shopify-Hmac-Sha256: test" \
     -d '{"test": true}'
   ```

## üöÄ Multi-Store Configuration

For multi-store setups, each store can have its own webhook secret configured in the UI. The global `SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` serves as the verification key for all incoming webhooks.

### Store-Specific Secrets
- Configure individual webhook secrets per store in the Multi-Store Webhook Management UI
- These are stored in localStorage and used for API calls
- The global secret is used for webhook verification

## üéØ Railway Deployment Best Practices

### 1. Use Sealed Variables for Production
```
SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET ‚Üí Sealed
```

### 2. Set Performance Variables
```
NODE_ENV=production
RAILWAY_HEALTHCHECK_TIMEOUT_SEC=30
RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_OVERLAP_SECONDS=10
```

### 3. Monitor Your Deployment
- Check health endpoint: `/health`
- Monitor Railway logs for webhook activity
- Verify webhook registration success in app logs

### 4. Test Before Going Live
- Use Railway's staging environment
- Test webhook registration with test stores
- Verify all multi-store configurations
